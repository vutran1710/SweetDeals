* Introduction
SweetDeals is a complete heavy Javascript/Typescript-oriented application that aims towards easy sharing deals
and payment-shares amongst group of friends or collegue. The inspiration came from how my friends in the office used to
place bulk-order of fruit drinks after lunch then got troubled in calculating how much each person would pay
afterwards.

* Features
- The full circle of software development
- A complete, or *full-stack so to say,* javascript application
  - TypeScript integration - the benefit & the tax
  - How Fuse-Box can be a great alternative to *webpack*
  - Mongodb, ExpressJS, React Server-side Rendering
- Testing a *full-stack* javasript application
- QA/QC, what to do from the point of the developers
- DevOps workflow, including CICD and Deployment
