* Introduction
SweetDeals is a complete heavy Javascript/Typescript-oriented application that aims towards easy sharing deals
and payment-shares amongst group of friends or collegue. The inspiration came from how my friends in the office used to
place bulk-order of fruit drinks after lunch then got troubled in calculating how much each person would pay
afterwards.

* Features
- The full circle of software development
- A complete, or *full-stack* so to say, javascript application
  - TypeScript integration - the benefit & the tax
  - How Fuse-Box can be a great alternative to *webpack*
  - Mongodb, ExpressJS, React Server-side Rendering
- Testing a *full-stack* javasript application
- QA/QC, what to do from the point of the developers
- DevOps workflow, including CICD and Deployment

* Development & CICD Strategy Flow
** TODO Development
- [x] Branch *master* must be strictly protected!
- [x] Feature implementation must be carried out on a separate branch
- [x] Each commit must be *linted* locally
- [x] If dev tries to commit on master branch, use husky to auto switch to a separated feature branch
- [x] To merge to master branch, a *PullRequest* must be submitted
** TODO PullRequest & CICD
- [x] Each PR will be verifed with automation of testing & bundling
- [x] If successful, allow to merge to *Master*
- [ ] Deploy with K8s
- [ ] Auto deploy upon merge to master
